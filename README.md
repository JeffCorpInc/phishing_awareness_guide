# 🎯 Phishing Awareness Training — A Complete Guide

Every day, 3.4 billion phishing emails are sent worldwide. Yet, most people fall victim simply because they do not know what to look for. That is exactly what this project aims to address. As part of my internship program at CodeAlpha, I developed a comprehensive Phishing Awareness Training presentation that covers:

🔍 How to recognize phishing emails and fake websites

🧠 The psychology behind social engineering tactics

🛡️ Best practices and safety measures to stay protected

📌 Real-world examples from major breaches (Twitter, MGM, and more)

✅ An interactive quiz to test your awareness

This guide is designed for everyday users — because cybersecurity is not just an IT problem; it is everyone's responsibility.
